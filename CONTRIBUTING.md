# Issues

Think you've found a bug or have a new feature to suggest? 

## Reporting a Bug
1. Use visual studio nuget to get the most recent master release if possible. We may have already
fixed your bug.

2. Search for similar issues. It's possible somebody has encountered
this bug already.

3. Keep up to date with feedback from the team on your ticket. Your
ticket may be closed if it becomes stale.

The more information you provide, the easier it is for us to validate that
there is a bug and the faster we'll be able to take action.

## Requesting a Feature

1. Search Issues for similar feature requests. It's possible somebody has
already asked for this feature or provided a pull request that we're still
discussing.

2. Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature you want and why
it's important to add. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful
to the majority of our users and not just a small subset.

3. If the feature is complex, consider writing some initial documentation for
it. If we do end up accepting the feature it will need to be documented and
this will also help us to understand it better ourselves.

4. Attempt a Pull Request. If you're at all able, start writing some code. We
always have more work to do than time to do it. If you can write some code
then that will speed the process along.
